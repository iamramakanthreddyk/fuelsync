# STEP_fix_20260828.md â€” Explicit nozzle reading RBAC and docs

## Project Context Summary
Nozzle reading endpoints previously relied solely on authentication. Role-based restrictions were checked only in controllers for update and void. OpenAPI documentation lacked any role hints.

## What We Did
- Applied `requireRole` middleware in `nozzleReading.route.ts` for all routes.
- Annotated nozzle reading operations in the OpenAPI specs with `x-roles` lists.
- Regenerated TypeScript API types.
- Updated changelog, implementation index and phase summary.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/openapi.yaml`
- `frontend/docs/openapi-v1.yaml`
- `src/types/api.ts`
- `docs/STEP_fix_20260828_COMMAND.md`
