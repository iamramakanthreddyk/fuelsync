# STEP_fix_20260908_COMMAND.md

## Project Context Summary
Daily reconciliation utilities handle finalizing sales and generating variance records. Existing tests only covered creation helpers.

## Steps Already Implemented
- `docs/STEP_fix_20260907_COMMAND.md` updated decimal parsing helpers.

## What to Build Now
- Add additional unit tests for `markDayAsFinalized` and `runReconciliation` to cover early-finalization and no-data scenarios.
- Ensure PostgreSQL is installed locally and the test database created via `scripts/ensure-db-init.js` before running tests.
- Update docs with this step information.
Security review found several issues: JWT tokens never expired, request debug logs exposed Authorization headers, database utilities printed credentials, and test routes were reachable in production.

## Steps Already Implemented
Latest fix documented in `docs/STEP_fix_20260907_COMMAND.md` improved decimal parsing.

## What to Build Now
- Read JWT expiration from `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` env variable with a secure default.
- Warn if `JWT_SECRET` uses the placeholder value in production.
- Mask Authorization header in `debugRequest` middleware.
- Sanitize database log output to avoid leaking credentials.
- Disable `/test` and `/test-login` routes in production.
- Update changelog, phase summary and implementation index.
