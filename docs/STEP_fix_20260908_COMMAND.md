## Steps Already Implemented

## What to Build Now
- Add additional unit tests for `markDayAsFinalized` and `runReconciliation` to cover early-finalization and no-data scenarios.
- Ensure PostgreSQL is installed locally and the test database created via `scripts/ensure-db-init.js` before running tests.
- Update docs with this step information.
