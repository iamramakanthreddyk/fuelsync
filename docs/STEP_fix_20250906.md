# STEP_fix_20250906.md â€” User creation updated_at bug

## Project Context Summary
Creating tenants or additional users sometimes failed with `null value in column "updated_at" of relation "users"`. The insert queries for user creation didn't set `updated_at`, and some databases lacked a default value.

## Steps Already Implemented
- `STEP_fix_20250905.md` added `updated_at` when inserting tenants.

## What Was Done Now
- Added `updated_at = NOW()` to all user insertion queries in `tenant.service.ts` and `user.service.ts` so creation succeeds regardless of DB defaults.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Append changelog entry.
- Update `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` and `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
