# STEP_fix_20250906.md â€” Credential consistency

## Project Context Summary
Several deployment docs referenced the default password `admin123` for all roles. However, the latest seed scripts use `Admin@123`. This mismatch caused login failures when following the outdated documentation.

## Steps Already Implemented
The previous step (`STEP_fix_20250905.md`) fixed the tenant creation `updated_at` bug.

## What Was Done Now
- Updated all documentation files to show `Admin@123` as the default password.
- Updated `src/services/admin.service.ts` and `scripts/setup-database.js` to use `Admin@123` and print the correct credentials.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry.
- Append to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Summarise in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
