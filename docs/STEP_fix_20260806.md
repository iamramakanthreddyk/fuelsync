# STEP_fix_20260806.md â€” Re-audit OpenAPI after sales update

## Project Context Summary
Developers reported that some endpoints might still be absent from `docs/openapi.yaml` after recent controller changes. The spec must remain aligned with all Express routers for tests and documentation.

## Steps Already Implemented
Documentation was previously brought up to date in steps 2026-08-03 through 2026-08-05.

## What We Built
- Added `scripts/audit-openapi-spec.ts` to compare router paths with the OpenAPI file.
- Ran the script and found no new missing routes.
- Attempted `npm test --silent -- -t openapiRoutes` which failed because `docker-compose` is not available in the environment.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/STEP_fix_20260806_COMMAND.md`
