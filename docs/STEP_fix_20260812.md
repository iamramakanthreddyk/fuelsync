# STEP_fix_20260812.md â€” Expanded domain fields

## Project Context Summary
UI components requested additional information from backend endpoints to reduce client-side joins. Prior steps only returned basic fields for prices, inventory, nozzles and readings.

## What We Built
- Extended nozzle listing to include `pumpName`.
- Nozzle reading queries now return nozzle number, previous reading, volume, amount, price per litre, fuel type, station name and attendant name.
- Fuel price lists expose `stationName` and a computed `isActive` flag.
- Fuel inventory results now include `minimumLevel` and `status` derived from current stock.
- OpenAPI schemas updated and TypeScript types regenerated.
