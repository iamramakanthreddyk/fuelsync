# STEP_fix_20260815.md â€” Station access query fix

## Project Context Summary
`user_stations` does not contain `tenant_id`. Dashboard and middleware queries attempted to filter by this field causing a runtime error when requesting data for a single station.

## What We Built
- Updated station access checks in dashboard controllers and middleware to join `stations` and match its `tenant_id`.
- Reintroduced station access validation in sales controller using the same query.
- Verified compilation succeeds with `npm run build`.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/STEP_fix_20260815_COMMAND.md`
