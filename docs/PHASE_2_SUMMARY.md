# PHASE\_2\_SUMMARY.md — Backend Services & Logic Summary

This document logs the design and validation details of **Phase 2: Backend Implementation** for FuelSync Hub. It includes authentication, service logic, API routes, validation layers, and feature enforcement.

## 🧩 Step Format

Each step includes:

* Step ID and Title
* Files modified/created
* Business rules enforced
* Validation logic
* Open design notes if any

### 🛠️ Step 2.1 – Authentication & Role Middleware

**Status:** ✅ Done
**Files:** `src/services/auth.service.ts`, `src/routes/auth.route.ts`, `src/middlewares/authenticateJWT.ts`, `src/middlewares/requireRole.ts`, `src/middlewares/requireStationAccess.ts`, `src/utils/jwt.ts`, `src/constants/auth.ts`, `src/types/auth.d.ts`

**Business Rules Covered:**

* JWT session auth
* Station-level access via `user_stations`
* Role checks enforced before route handlers

**Validation To Perform:**

* JWT issued via login and stored in HttpOnly cookies
* Token includes `user_id`, `tenant_id`, and `role`
* `requireAuth()` checks validity

**Overview:**
* Login route validates credentials with bcrypt and returns JWT
* Middleware verifies tokens and checks user role and station access

**Validations Performed:**
* Manual testing via `ts-node-dev` ensured tokens reject invalid credentials
* Verified middleware attaches `req.user` with correct fields

### 🛠️ Step 2.2 – Delta-Based Sale Service

**Status:** ⏳ Pending
**Files:** `sale.service.ts`, `sale.test.ts`

**Business Rules Covered:**

* New reading → delta → validate → fetch price → insert sale
* Sale volume must be non-negative, price must exist

**Validation To Perform:**

* Correct fuel price lookup based on timestamp
* Prevent delta < 0
* Ensure last reading is used as baseline

---

### 🛠️ Step 2.3 – Sales & Creditors API

**Status:** ⏳ Pending
**Files:** `routes/v1/sales.ts`, `routes/v1/creditors.ts`, `openapi.yaml`

**Business Rules Covered:**

* Credit sales blocked if limit exceeded
* List and update creditor payments

**Validation To Perform:**

* Zod or Joi request validation
* Consistent error responses (`status`, `code`, `message`)
* Tenant + role scope must match all requests

---

### 🛠️ Step 2.4 – Plan Enforcement Middleware

**Status:** ⏳ Pending
**Files:** `middleware/planLimit.ts`, `services/plan.service.ts`

**Business Rules Covered:**

* Prevent creation of stations/pumps/users over plan
* Feature flags (creditors, API access, reports)

**Validation To Perform:**

* Plan config sourced at runtime from `planConfig.ts`
* Blocking logic wrapped in Express middleware

> 🧠 After implementing each step, update the corresponding block with status, files created, and key validations.
