# STEP_fix_20260719.md â€” Close previous price ranges

## Project Context Summary
Fuel price creation now accepts optional `effectiveTo` but open ranges were left
untouched when new prices were created.

## Steps Already Implemented
All fixes up to `2026-07-18` including date validations.

## What We Built
- Creation handlers update any open price for the same station and fuel type by
  setting its `effective_to` to the new price's `valid_from`.
- Both Prisma controller and service function have the override logic.
