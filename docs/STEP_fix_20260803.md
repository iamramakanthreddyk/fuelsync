# STEP_fix_20260803.md — Sync OpenAPI with controllers

## Project Context Summary
Sales controller and several service routes existed without corresponding OpenAPI entries. Automated tests rely on `docs/openapi.yaml` for path discovery.

## Steps Already Implemented
Documentation was accurate through 2026‑08‑02 with passing tests.

## What We Built
- Added missing paths such as `/sales/analytics`, `/fuel-deliveries/inventory`, `/fuel-prices/validate/{stationId}`, `/fuel-prices/missing` and `/nozzle-readings/*` helpers.
- Documented pump settings, tenant listing and reconciliation endpoints.
- Updated the changelog, phase summary and implementation index.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/STEP_fix_20260803_COMMAND.md`
