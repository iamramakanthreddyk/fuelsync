# STEP_fix_20251210.md â€” Resolve TypeScript build errors

## Project Context Summary
The backend codebase recently transitioned several services to Prisma but lingering
pg-based implementations caused compilation failures. Running `tsc` revealed
missing imports, mismatched types and outdated property names across controllers,
services and middleware.

## What Was Done Now
- Standardised plan limit checks to use the shared Prisma client.
- Added missing `Pool` and Prisma imports where required.
- Fixed implicit `any` parameters and corrected field names.
- Updated price lookup helper to use `fuelPrice` model name.
- Adjusted routes to use the updated plan limit middleware.
- Verified `npm run build` succeeds and tests run (no-op).

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
