# STEP_fix_20260813.md â€” Adjust display field calculations

## Project Context Summary
Additional display fields were added previously but had minor issues with
inventory status values and price activation logic. Type generation also failed due
to an invalid OpenAPI patch.

## What We Built
- Corrected status calculation in `fuelInventory.service.ts` to return `normal`,
  `low`, or `critical`.
- Updated fuel price controller to check `validFrom` when determining `isActive`.
- Added enum values for `FuelInventory.status` in the OpenAPI specification.
- Updated nozzle reading queries to compute volume and amount using window
  functions.
- Regenerated TypeScript API definitions.

## Required Documentation Updates

- `docs/STEP_fix_20260813_COMMAND.md`
