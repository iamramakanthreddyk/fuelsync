# STEP_fix_20260908.md â€” Security hardening

## Project Context Summary
A code audit revealed overly permissive JWT lifetime, verbose credential logging, and public debug routes.

## What Was Done Now
- JWT expiration is configurable via `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` with a default of `1h`.
- A warning is emitted if `JWT_SECRET` is not provided in production.
- Authorization headers are masked in debug logs.
- Database utilities no longer log raw connection details.
- Test endpoints are disabled in production builds.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
