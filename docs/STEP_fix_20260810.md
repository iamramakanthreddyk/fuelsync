# STEP_fix_20260810.md â€” ReconciliationRecord Contract Alignment

## Project Context Summary
The frontend contract defines `ReconciliationRecord` using nozzle readings (`openingReading`, `closingReading`, `variance`). Backend implementation and OpenAPI spec were using cash totals instead. This caused mismatched data models.

## What We Built
- Extended `day_reconciliations` tables with `opening_reading`, `closing_reading` and `variance` fields in schema templates.
- Updated `reconciliation.service.ts` to compute these readings per station from nozzle readings and sales volume and save them.
- Adjusted controller responses to expose the new fields.
- Updated OpenAPI documentation in `docs/openapi.yaml` and `frontend/docs/openapi-v1.yaml` to replace `totalExpected` and `cashReceived` with the new reading-based properties.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/STEP_fix_20260810_COMMAND.md`
