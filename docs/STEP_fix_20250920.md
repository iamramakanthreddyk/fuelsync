# STEP_fix_20250920.md â€” Tenant_id column migration

## Project Context Summary
The unified schema expects every tenant table to contain a `tenant_id` UUID
column. Reports from the demo API show errors like `column "tenant_id" does not
exist`, meaning older tables were created before the unified migration.

## Steps Already Implemented
All fixes through `STEP_fix_20250919.md` are complete.

## What Was Done Now
- Added migration `006_add_tenant_id_columns.sql` that checks each table and adds
  a `tenant_id` column with a foreign key to `public.tenants(id)` if missing.
- This migration ensures legacy databases match the unified schema so queries in
  all services no longer fail.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` with a new fix entry.
- Append row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Update `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md` with the fix details.
