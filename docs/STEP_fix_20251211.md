# STEP_fix_20251211.md â€” Explicit typing cleanup

## Project Context Summary
Running `tsc` previously flagged implicit `any` errors in several controllers and services. Raw query helpers also produced warnings when generics were supplied. The backend should compile cleanly with strict TypeScript settings.

## What Was Done Now
- Added explicit parameter types for `map` and `reduce` callbacks across controllers and services.
- Typed transaction callbacks with `Prisma.TransactionClient`.
- Replaced generic annotations on `$queryRaw` calls with type assertions.
- Verified `npm run build` completes without errors.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
