# STEP_fix_20260809_COMMAND.md
## Project Context Summary
The frontend TypeScript contract expects `updatedAt`, `isActive`, and `permissions` fields in the `User` object. The official OpenAPI spec and backend responses only include `createdAt` and omit these additional fields.

## Steps Already Implemented
- All fixes through `2026-08-08` including SuperAdmin analytics expansion.

## What to Build Now
- Verify database schema for the `users` table to check availability of `isActive`, `permissions`, and `updated_at` columns.
- If the column exists, expose the field in API responses and document it in `openapi.yaml`.
- Inform the user if a column is missing.
- Update controllers to return `updatedAt` because `updated_at` exists in the schema.
- Leave `isActive` and `permissions` undocumented since they don't exist.
- Document the work in changelog, phase summary and implementation index.
