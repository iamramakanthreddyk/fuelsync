# STEP_fix_20260821.md â€” Document void endpoint in OpenAPI

## Project Context Summary
The backend already exposes `POST /v1/nozzle-readings/:id/void` to invalidate incorrect readings. However, the OpenAPI documentation and generated types did not include this route.

## What We Did
- Added the `POST /nozzle-readings/{id}/void` operation to both OpenAPI specs.
- Regenerated TypeScript API definitions.
- Updated changelog, phase summary and implementation index accordingly.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/STEP_fix_20260821_COMMAND.md`
