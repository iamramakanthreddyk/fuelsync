# STEP_fix_20260716.md — Azure deployment docs

## Project Context Summary
The codebase referenced Azure deployment guides that were missing. Developers had
no instructions for using the provided `setup-azure-db.js` script or connecting a
local instance to an Azure PostgreSQL server.

## Steps Already Implemented
All backend fixes up to 2026‑07‑15 are complete. Scripts for Azure setup already
exist under `scripts/`.

## What Was Done Now
- Wrote `docs/AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` detailing required environment
  variables and how to run the setup script.
- Added `docs/AZURE_DEV_SETUP.md` with instructions for local development
  against an Azure database.
- Linked both guides from the README and updated the implementation index,
  changelog and phase summary.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
