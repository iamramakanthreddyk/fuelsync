# STEP_fix_20260814_COMMAND.md
## Project Context Summary
Two issues were identified:
1. The user update endpoint did not verify whether the updated user actually existed after calling `prisma.user.findUnique`.
2. The computed fuel inventory API always returned status `normal` because the minimum level for each station and fuel type was not retrieved.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Fixes through `2026-08-13` recorded in `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.

## What to Build Now
- After each `prisma.user.findUnique` call in `user.controller.ts` update logic, check if a record was found.
- Return `errorResponse(res, 404, 'User not found')` when the record is missing.
- Ensure both SuperAdmin and tenant update paths include this check.
- In `fuelInventory.service.ts` fetch each station's `minimum_level` in `getComputedFuelInventory` and compute the status based on the retrieved value.
- Run `npm run build` to verify successful compilation.
