# STEP_fix_20260816.md â€” Owner station access

## Project Context Summary
Owners should automatically access all stations of their tenant, but station-level checks required a record in `user_stations`, causing 403 errors on dashboard and sales queries.

## What We Built
- Introduced `hasStationAccess` utility to verify access, granting owners access when the station belongs to their tenant.
- Updated middleware and controllers to use this helper.
- Verified compilation with `npm run build`.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/STEP_fix_20260816_COMMAND.md`
