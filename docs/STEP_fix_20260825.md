# STEP_fix_20260825.md â€” Azure WebApp workflow

## Project Context Summary
Previous fixes introduced a Docker-based deployment workflow. For standard App Service deployments we want to archive the build and use `azure/webapps-deploy`. This simplifies setup and aligns with the postinstall Prisma generation.

## What Was Done Now
- Removed `docker-azure.yml` workflow.
- Added `azure-webapp.yml` workflow that installs dependencies, builds, tests and deploys the zipped app.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/STEP_fix_20260825_COMMAND.md`
