# STEP_2_63_COMMAND.md
## Project Context Summary
FuelSync Hub is a multi-tenant ERP for fuel stations. Up through **Step 2.62** the documentation included basic Mermaid diagrams of station setup and daily readings. Users requested a more comprehensive view including sales calculation, validation edge cases, analytics flow and database relationships.

## Steps Already Implemented
- CRUD APIs for all domain entities
- Mermaid diagrams showing simple setup and reading flows (Step 2.62)

## What to Build Now
- Expand `docs/journeys/USER_API_FLOW.md` to cover:
  - Sale calculation using nozzle delta and fuel prices
  - Validation edge cases when prices are missing or previous day not finalized
  - How reconciliation feeds analytics
  - An ER diagram connecting tables (stations, pumps, nozzles, readings, sales, recon)
- Update `CHANGELOG.md`, `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` for Step 2.63

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
