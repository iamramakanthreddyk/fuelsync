# STEP_fix_20260727_COMMAND.md

## Project Context Summary
Users reported hitting a `Fuel price outdated` error when submitting nozzle readings. The service rejected prices older than seven days even if a newer price was later recorded.

## Steps Already Implemented
Fixes through `2026-07-26` including OpenAPI contract test updates.

## What to Build Now
- Remove the outdated price validation from `src/services/nozzleReading.service.ts` so readings use the latest valid price without date restriction.
- Document the change in the changelog, implementation index, and phase summary.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/STEP_fix_20260727_COMMAND.md`
