# STEP_fix_20260729_COMMAND.md

## Project Context Summary
FuelSync Hub includes many API controllers but unit tests only covered a few of them. We need a quick check that each controller exports its handler factory so routes can be wired correctly.

## Steps Already Implemented
Latest step added tests for station controller and inventory service (see `STEP_fix_20260728_COMMAND.md`).

## What to Build Now
- Add a Jest test that loads every file in `src/controllers` and ensures a `create*` function returns an object of handlers.
- No production code changes.
- Document the new test in CHANGELOG, IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX and PHASE summaries.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/STEP_fix_20260729.md`
