# STEP_2_62_COMMAND.md
## Project Context Summary
FuelSync Hub is a multi-tenant ERP for fuel stations. Backend development is complete up to **Step 2.61** which added the `todays-sales` summary endpoint. Documentation covers APIs and workflows but lacks a visual overview of the station setup and daily reading process.

## Steps Already Implemented
- All CRUD APIs for stations, pumps, nozzles, fuel prices and nozzle readings.
- Documentation through `Step 2.61` and various fix steps.

## What to Build Now
- Create a new documentation file `docs/journeys/USER_API_FLOW.md` containing Mermaid diagrams that illustrate:
  - Owner/Manager setting up a station, pumps, nozzles and fuel prices.
  - Attendant entering daily nozzle readings.
- Diagrams must reference exact API routes such as `/api/v1/stations` and `/api/v1/nozzle-readings`.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md`, `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` to record this documentation step.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
