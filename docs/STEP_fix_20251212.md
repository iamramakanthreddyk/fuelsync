# STEP_fix_20251212.md â€” Automate Prisma client generation

## Project Context Summary
Azure deployments run `npm install` which triggers any `postinstall` script. Generating the Prisma client during this step ensures the backend starts with the correct client without extra pipeline tasks.

## What Was Done Now
- Added a `postinstall` script to `package.json` that runs `prisma generate`.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
