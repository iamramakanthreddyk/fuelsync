# STEP_fix_20260717.md â€” Dashboard station access

## Project Context Summary
Dashboard metrics APIs allowed any authenticated owner or manager to supply a
`stationId` without verifying membership. Other controllers implemented a
`user_stations` check to enforce station-level permissions.

## Steps Already Implemented
Fix steps through `2026-07-16` introduced Azure deployment docs. Sales
controller already validates station access.

## What We Built
- Added station access validation to all dashboard controller handlers that
  accept a `stationId` query parameter.
- Handlers return a 403 error when the requesting user is not linked to the
  station via `public.user_stations`.
- Added unit tests covering the `getSalesSummary` handler for both allowed and
  denied scenarios.
