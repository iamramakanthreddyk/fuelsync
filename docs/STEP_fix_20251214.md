# STEP_fix_20251214.md â€” Uniform dashboard empty handling

## Project Context Summary
Recent fixes ensured specific dashboard endpoints return empty arrays when no data exists. Other endpoints should behave the same for consistency.

## Steps Already Implemented
Backend Phase 2 is complete up to 2025-12-13 with fixes for payment breakdown and top creditors.

## What Was Done Now
- Added empty result checks to `getFuelTypeBreakdown` and `getDailySalesTrend` in `dashboard.controller.ts`.
- Verified that all dashboard endpoints now return empty arrays when no records are found.
- Ran `npm test` and `npm run build` to ensure stability.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
