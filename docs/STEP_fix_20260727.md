# STEP_fix_20260727.md — Remove outdated price restriction

## Project Context Summary
Previously, nozzle readings failed if the associated fuel price was recorded more than seven days before the reading date.

## Steps Already Implemented
All fixes up to `2026-07-26` including updated OpenAPI contract tests.

## What We Built
- Deleted the 7‑day validity check in `nozzleReading.service.ts`. Readings now accept any price retrieved by `getPriceAtTimestamp`.
