# STEP_fix_20260909.md â€” Prisma UUID mapping across models

## Project Context Summary
`POST /api/v1/nozzle-readings` called `getPriceAtTimestamp`, which queried the `fuel_prices` table using Prisma. Because several models declared UUID columns as plain strings, Prisma generated SQL that compared `text` to `uuid`, causing requests to fail.

## What We Did
- Marked all model `id` and foreign key fields with `@db.Uuid` in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
- Regenerated the Prisma client.
- Updated changelog, implementation index and phase summary.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/STEP_fix_20260909_COMMAND.md`
