# STEP_fix_20251213.md — Handle empty dashboard results

## Project Context Summary
Dashboard analytics endpoints sometimes returned a 500 error when the query found no matching rows. The frontend expects an empty array instead of a server error.

## Steps Already Implemented
Backend Phase 2 and numerous fixes are complete up to 2025‑12‑12 including Prisma client generation automation.

## What Was Done Now
- Updated `getPaymentMethodBreakdown` and `getTopCreditors` in `dashboard.controller.ts` to return an empty array when no rows are returned.
- Verified `npm run build` and `npm test` succeed.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
