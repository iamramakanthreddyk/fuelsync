# STEP_fix_20260728_COMMAND.md

## Project Context Summary
Previous test coverage only touched a few controllers and services. To ensure all APIs remain stable, additional unit tests are required.

## Steps Already Implemented
Fixes through `2026-07-27` including removal of outdated fuel price validation.

## What to Build Now
- Add Jest unit tests for `station.controller` and `inventory.service`.
- Mock database calls so tests run without a real DB.
- Document the new tests in CHANGELOG, IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX and PHASE summaries.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/STEP_fix_20260728_COMMAND.md`
