# STEP_fix_20260829.md â€” Automated RBAC validation

## Project Context Summary
Previous steps implemented RBAC middleware and documented allowed roles in the OpenAPI specification. However no test exercised every operation to confirm these restrictions.

## What We Did
- Added `JWT_SECRET` to `.env.test` for predictable token signing.
- Implemented `tests/openapi.rbac.test.ts` which reads `docs/openapi.yaml` and automatically issues requests for each `x-roles` operation as owner, manager, attendant and unauthenticated users.
- Ensured database setup via `ensure-db-init.js` and verified the application builds and starts.
- All Jest suites including the new RBAC tests pass.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
- `test-report.md`
- `docs/STEP_fix_20260829_COMMAND.md`
