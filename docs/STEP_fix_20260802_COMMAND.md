# STEP_fix_20260802_COMMAND.md
## Project Context Summary
Earlier fixes expanded the API spec and tests but unit tests still skipped on a clean environment because PostgreSQL was not installed. The README documented starting a Docker database but omitted setting the local `postgres` password, causing connection failures.

## Steps Already Implemented
All fixes through `2026-08-01` provide passing tests when a local database is available.

## What to Build Now
- Document the manual Postgres setup command to set the `postgres` password.
- Ensure integration tests run by provisioning Postgres in the CI environment.
- Record this fix in the changelog, phase summary and implementation index.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/STEP_fix_20260802.md`
