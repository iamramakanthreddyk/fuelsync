# STEP_fix_20260827.md â€” CI build deployment

## Project Context Summary
Postinstall-based Prisma generation caused permission issues on Azure. Building and generating the client in CI avoids these runtime problems.

## What Was Done Now
- Removed `postinstall` from `package.json`.
- Updated the `build` script to `npx prisma generate && tsc`.
- Added `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` which builds the app and deploys it with `azure/webapps-deploy`.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/STEP_fix_20260827_COMMAND.md`
