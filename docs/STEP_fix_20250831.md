# STEP_fix_20250831.md â€” Consistent DB Password Variable

## Project Context Summary
In different environments the database password variable was referenced as
`DB_PASS` or `DB_PASSWORD`. This inconsistency caused confusion when starting
the app or running tests.

## Steps Already Implemented
All backend services use `process.env.DB_PASSWORD` as of `STEP_fix_20250830.md`.
However development and test `.env` files, Docker compose config and Jest
helpers still relied on `DB_PASS`.

## What Was Done Now
- Renamed `DB_PASS` to `DB_PASSWORD` in `.env.development`, `.env.test` and
  `docker-compose.yml`.
- Updated Jest setup scripts and test utilities to read `DB_PASSWORD`.
- Verified no remaining uses of the old variable in the codebase.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry.
- Append row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Summarise in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
