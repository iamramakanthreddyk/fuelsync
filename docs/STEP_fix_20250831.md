# STEP_fix_20250831.md â€” Admin routes completion

## Project Context Summary
Frontend integration expects full support for SuperAdmin routes including a dedicated analytics endpoint and tenant summary metrics. Admin login route was added previously but some admin endpoints were still missing and tenant creation failed on Azure due to `updated_at` default issues.

## Steps Already Implemented
See `STEP_fix_20250830.md` which introduced the `/api/v1/admin/auth/login` endpoint.

## What Was Done Now
- Mounted `createAdminAnalyticsRouter` at `/api/v1/admin/analytics`.
- Added `getTenantSummary` handler and route `/api/v1/admin/tenants/summary`.
- Fixed tenant creation to explicitly set `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Add changelog entry.
- Append row to `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Summarise in `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`.
