# STEP_fix_20260718.md â€” Fuel price date options

## Project Context Summary
Fuel price creation previously required a `validFrom` timestamp. Clients sometimes omit this, expecting the backend to apply the current date. The schema also includes an optional `effective_to` field that was not exposed.

## Steps Already Implemented
All fixes up to `2026-07-17` are present including dashboard access validation.

## What We Built
- `FuelPriceInput` now allows `validFrom` to be omitted and added an optional `effectiveTo` property.
- `validateCreateFuelPrice` assigns the current date when `validFrom` is missing and ensures `effectiveTo` is later.
- Controllers and services pass through the new field and API contract types were updated.
