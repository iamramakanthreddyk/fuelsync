# STEP_fix_20260718.md â€” OpenAPI server path

## Project Context Summary
The OpenAPI specification still referenced `/v1` as the server path even though all backend routes are served from `/api/v1`.

## Steps Already Implemented
Fixes through `2026-07-17` covered dashboard permission checks and Azure docs.

## What Was Done Now
- Updated `docs/openapi.yaml` and `frontend/docs/openapi-v1.yaml` so the server URL is `/api/v1`.
- Generated `docs/openapi-spec.yaml` for tests and future client generation.
- Documented the change in the changelog and implementation index.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/STEP_fix_20260718_COMMAND.md`
