# STEP_fix_20260818.md â€” Reconciliation documentation clarifications

## Project Context Summary
Reviewers requested more clarity around the daily reconciliation process.
SQL snippets, variance calculations and the cash difference logic were
unclear to new contributors.

## What We Built
- Created `RECONCILIATION_API.md` detailing the reconciliation workflow and key endpoints.
- Documented the SQL query to aggregate nozzle readings with explanatory notes.
- Added a plain language description of the variance formula.
- Explained how reported cash differences produce `match`, `over` or `short` statuses.
- Emphasized the single reconciliation per station per day rule.
- Updated changelog and phase summary with this documentation fix.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/STEP_fix_20260818_COMMAND.md`
