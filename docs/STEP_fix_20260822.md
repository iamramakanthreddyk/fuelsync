# STEP_fix_20260822.md — Compile before start

## Project Context Summary
Deployment on Render failed because the Node start command expected compiled files in `dist/`, but the build step only ran `npm install`.

## What We Did
- Added a `prestart` script to `package.json` that runs `npm run build`.
# STEP_fix_20260822.md — Azure deployment zip fix

## Project Context Summary
Deployments were failing because the workflow zipped the entire repository, including GitHub configuration and source files. Azure App Service expects only the production files.

## What We Did
- Modified `.github/workflows/main_fuelsync.yml` to zip `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `node_modules` and the `dist` build output.
- Updated changelog, phase summary and implementation index.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/STEP_fix_20260822_COMMAND.md`
