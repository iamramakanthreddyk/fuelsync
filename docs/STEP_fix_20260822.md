# STEP_fix_20260822.md â€” Azure runtime crash fix

## Project Context Summary
The deployed container exited immediately because the application was listening on the wrong default port and the production build did not generate the Prisma client.

## What We Did
- Changed the server default to use `process.env.PORT` or `8080`.
- Updated `package.json` build script to run `tsc && npx prisma generate` and kept the `start` script pointing to the compiled file.
- Documented the fix and updated the implementation index.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/STEP_fix_20260822_COMMAND.md`
