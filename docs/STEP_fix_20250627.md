# STEP_fix_20250627.md â€” Local DB Install for Tests

## Project Context Summary
Tests were previously skipped because PostgreSQL was not available and `docker-compose` was missing. The local setup guide instructs installing Postgres, but did not mention verifying Docker Compose. We installed PostgreSQL, seeded the dev database, and successfully ran all tests.

## Steps Already Implemented
See `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md` for Phase 2 completion and previous fixes up to 2025-06-26.

## What Was Done Now
- Installed PostgreSQL 16 locally using `apt-get` and started the service.
- Seeded the public schema and demo tenant as described in the setup guide.
- Ran `npm test` which created and seeded `fuelsync_test` and all suites passed.
- Documented how to resolve `docker-compose: command not found` in `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`.
- Noted Docker Compose requirement in `LOCAL_DEV_SETUP.md`.

## Required Documentation Updates
- Added this fix entry to `CHANGELOG.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
- Updated `LOCAL_DEV_SETUP.md` and `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` with the new notes.
