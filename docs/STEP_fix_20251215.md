# STEP_fix_20251215.md â€” Empty list handling across endpoints

## Project Context Summary
Previous fixes ensured dashboard analytics returned empty arrays when no data exists. Review showed other list endpoints (stations, pumps, nozzles, readings, deliveries, etc.) relied on implicit empty arrays returned by ORM or queries. To make behaviour explicit and consistent, each list endpoint should return an empty array immediately when no records are found.

## Steps Already Implemented
Backend Phase 2 is complete with multiple fixes up to 2025-12-14 including uniform dashboard handling.

## What Was Done Now
- Added explicit `if (rows.length === 0)` checks to list endpoints for stations, pumps, nozzles, nozzle readings, deliveries, fuel inventory, creditors, credit payments, sales, alerts, reconciliations and tenants.
- Each returns `[]` when no records exist.
- Updated CHANGELOG, IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX and PHASE_2_SUMMARY.
- Verified build and tests.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
