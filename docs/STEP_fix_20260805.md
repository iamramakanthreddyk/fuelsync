# STEP_fix_20260805.md — Verify OpenAPI against controllers

## Project Context Summary
Sales controller changes prompted a review of all API routes. The OpenAPI specification must remain synchronized so tests can rely on it.

## Steps Already Implemented
- Previous steps `2026-08-03` and `2026-08-04` brought most routes into the spec.

## What We Built
- Reviewed every router under `src/routes` and cross‑checked `docs/openapi.yaml`.
- Confirmed endpoints for inventory, pumps, nozzle readings, analytics, reports and admin management are represented.
- No missing paths were found, so the spec remains unchanged.
- Documented this verification step and attempted to run the OpenAPI route tests.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/STEP_fix_20260805_COMMAND.md`
