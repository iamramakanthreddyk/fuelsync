# STEP_fix_20260811.md â€” ReconciliationRequest cleanup

## Project Context Summary
After shifting `ReconciliationRecord` to reading-based fields, the create request schema and controller still referenced cash totals and the `reconciliationDate` field. This caused mismatched expectations between frontend and backend.

## What We Built
- Removed `totalExpected` and `cashReceived` properties from the `CreateReconciliationRequest` schema in both OpenAPI specs.
- Updated `reconciliation.controller.ts` to read the `date` field from the request body.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/STEP_fix_20260811_COMMAND.md`
