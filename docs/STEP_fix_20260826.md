# STEP_fix_20260826.md â€” Docker Prisma permission

## Project Context Summary
The Azure App Service container was exiting with `sh: 1: prisma: Permission denied` during startup. The Prisma CLI lacked execute permissions in the image.

## What Was Done Now
- Added `RUN chmod +x ./node_modules/.bin/prisma` to the `Dockerfile` so Prisma commands work during build and runtime.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/STEP_fix_20260826_COMMAND.md`
