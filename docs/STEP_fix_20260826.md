# STEP_fix_20260826.md â€” Auto DB bootstrap

## Project Context Summary
Deployments now run migrations in `postinstall`, but a fresh database still requires running `setup-db` manually. We need automatic detection so any new environment can boot with only environment variables set.

## What We Did
- Added `scripts/ensure-db-init.js` which checks if the `public.users` table exists. If not, it invokes `scripts/setup-unified-db.js`; otherwise it runs `node scripts/migrate.js up`.
- Updated `package.json` `postinstall` to use this new script after generating the Prisma client.
- Updated `RENDER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` with a note that `postinstall` auto-initialises the DB using the environment variables provided. Works for Azure too as the script is generic.

## Required Documentation Updates
