# STEP_fix_20260729.md â€” Verify controller exports

## Project Context Summary
Previous tests only validated a few controllers directly. To ensure all controllers expose their handler factories, add a simple test that iterates through the directory.

## Steps Already Implemented
Up through `2026-07-28` we added tests for the station controller and inventory service.

## What We Built
- Added `tests/controllersExist.test.ts` which loads each file in `src/controllers` and asserts that a `create*` function exists and returns handlers.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/STEP_fix_20260729_COMMAND.md`
