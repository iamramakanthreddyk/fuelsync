# Cash Reports Access Fix

## Problem
- 502 Bad Gateway error when accessing `/api/v1/attendant/cash-reports`
- Owners and Managers could not see cash reports from their team

## Root Cause
1. **502 Error**: Missing error handling in cash reports controller
2. **Access Issue**: Service was filtering cash reports by `user_id`, so Owners/Managers could only see reports they personally created

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Error Handling
- Wrapped cash reports controller in try-catch to prevent 502 errors
- Added table existence check to handle missing `cash_reports` table gracefully
- Returns empty array instead of crashing when table doesn't exist

### 2. Fixed Access Permissions
- **Owner**: Can see ALL cash reports in their tenant
- **Manager**: Can see ALL cash reports in their tenant  
- **Attendant**: Can only see their own cash reports

### 3. Enhanced Data
- Added `created_by_name` field to show who created each report
- Added proper COALESCE for optional columns (card_amount, upi_amount)

## API Behavior

### Before Fix
```sql
-- All roles could only see their own reports
WHERE cr.tenant_id = $1 AND cr.user_id = $2
```

### After Fix
```sql
-- Owner/Manager: See all reports in tenant
WHERE cr.tenant_id = $1

-- Attendant: See only own reports  
WHERE cr.tenant_id = $1 AND cr.user_id = $2
```

## Response Format
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "reports": [
      {
        "id": "uuid",
        "stationId": "uuid", 
        "stationName": "Station Name",
        "date": "2024-01-15",
        "cashAmount": 5000.00,
        "creditAmount": 1200.00,
        "cardAmount": 800.00,
        "upiAmount": 300.00,
        "createdByName": "Attendant Name"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Error Handling
- Returns `500` with message instead of crashing server
- Handles missing `cash_reports` table gracefully
- Logs errors for debugging while maintaining service availability

## Deployment Status
- ✅ Code compiled successfully
- ✅ Error handling added
- ✅ Role-based access implemented
- ✅ Backward compatible with existing data

Now Owners and Managers can properly access cash reports from their entire team.
