# FuelSync API Contract Synchronization

This document outlines the changes made to synchronize the frontend API contract with the backend API specification.

## Overview of Changes

1. **Backend Changes**
   - Added `lastReading` field to nozzle responses
   - Enhanced nozzle service to include the latest reading for each nozzle

2. **Frontend Changes**
   - Updated API contract interfaces to match backend specification
   - Enhanced data transformation in services to handle both camelCase and snake_case
   - Improved error handling and edge cases in components

## Backend Changes

### 1. Update Nozzle Service

Replace the content of `src/services/nozzle.service.ts` with the content from `src/services/nozzle.service.patch.ts`:

```bash
cp src/services/nozzle.service.patch.ts src/services/nozzle.service.ts
```

The key change is in the `listNozzles` function, which now includes a SQL query to fetch the latest reading for each nozzle:

```sql
SELECT 
  n.*,
  p.name as pump_name,
  (
    SELECT reading 
    FROM public.nozzle_readings nr 
    WHERE nr.nozzle_id = n.id 
    AND nr.tenant_id = n.tenant_id
    ORDER BY nr.recorded_at DESC 
    LIMIT 1
  ) as last_reading
FROM public.nozzles n
LEFT JOIN public.pumps p ON n.pump_id = p.id
WHERE n.tenant_id = $1
${pumpId ? 'AND n.pump_id = $2' : ''}
ORDER BY n.nozzle_number ASC
```

## Frontend Changes

### 1. API Contract Updates

The following interfaces were updated in `src/api/api-contract.ts`:

- `Nozzle`: Added `stationId` and `stationName` fields
- `UpdateNozzleRequest`: Removed unsupported fuel types ('cng', 'lpg')
- `AttendantNozzle`: Added `lastReading` field and removed unsupported fuel types
- `Sale`: Added `readingId` field
- `NozzleReading`: Added additional fields from backend response
- `ReadingValidation`: Added `missingPrice` field

### 2. Service Enhancements

Updated the following services to handle both camelCase and snake_case property names:

- `nozzlesService.ts`: Enhanced `getNozzles` method
- `readingsService.ts`: Enhanced `getLatestReading` method and updated payment method types

### 3. Component Improvements

Updated the `LastReadingDisplay` component in `FuelNozzleCard.tsx` to:
- Handle edge cases better
- Use proper number formatting with `Intl.NumberFormat`
- Improve null/undefined checking

## Verification

After applying these changes:

1. The nozzle cards should display the last reading value when available
2. API calls should work correctly with both camelCase and snake_case property names
3. All components should handle edge cases gracefully

## Why These Changes Were Made

These changes ensure that:
1. The frontend and backend API contracts are in sync
2. Data is properly transformed between the backend and frontend
3. Components handle all possible data scenarios
4. The application works smoothly without errors

## Additional Notes

- The backend changes are minimal and focused on providing the data needed by the frontend
- The frontend changes are more extensive to handle the various data formats from the backend
- All changes maintain backward compatibility
